I'm currently about to finish my undergraduate studies in mathematics and computer science. And while my formal education is coming to an end, I find that I haven't even scratched the surface of what is to be learned. What's even worse is that I've found that the knowledge I have acquired disappears without constant use, and while I can usually relearn things quickly, I'd prefer if I didn't have to go through the process. To remediate these problems, I've decided to start this blog.

An epoch is defined as the beginning of a distinctive period in the history of someone or something. In machine learning, an epoch marks a single pass a machine learning algorithm takes through the training set. When training a machine learning model, it is common to pass through hundreds to thousands of epochs in order for the model to learn correctly. I find that these two definitions parallel my reasons for starting this blog. The first definition signifies the start of my education outside of academia. The second definition signifies my second pass through the essentials of computer science and mathematics, to relearn and further solidify my understanding of the subjects.

With that being said, my two main goals for this blog are:

  1. Write about topics in computer science and mathematics that I haven't learned yet.

  2. Write about various undergraduate topics in computer science and mathematics.

In regards to the first goal I would like to work my way up to understanding Marcus Hutter's work on artificial general intelligence and AIXI. Regarding the second, ultimately I'd like to include two recurring series. One on how to build a computer starting from logic gates all the way up to building an operating system and connecting it to the internet (in similar fashion to the popular course "From Nand to Tetris"). And another to build up mathematics from axiomatic set theory and mathematical logic, although I'm considering doing a more expository guide on undergraduate level mathematics classes as well.
