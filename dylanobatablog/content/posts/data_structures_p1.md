In the last few posts we learned about algorithms. Algorithms generally work on and manipulate collections of data to arrive at a solution. Therefore, it is crucial to consider how we can store and represent our data so that our algorithms can make use of them efficiently. Objects that represent collections of data are called *data structures*, and together with algorithms form a computer program.
