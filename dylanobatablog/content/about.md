My name is Dylan Obata. I recently finished my undergraduate degrees at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in mathematics and computer science. I'm currently a researcher at the Real-Time Intelligent Systems lab at UNLV, where I focus on applying computer vision to the field of action quality assessment (AQA).

This site is a place for me to articulate my thoughts on various topics and to showcase my work. I try to put out my best work but unfortunately I am blind to my mistakes. If you see any errors in my work, or have suggestions on any improvements, feel free to let me know about it.
